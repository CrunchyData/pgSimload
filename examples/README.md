# Examples directory

This directory contains examples of different usages of pgSimLoad. 

They are all described in the documentation you can read at `doc/README.md`,
and each subdirectory shows examples of the current 3 execution modes of
pgSimload.

Feel free to modify/adapt to your needs !

Please read README.md in any of the subdirectories here, when there's one,
writing docs is a long process :'-)
